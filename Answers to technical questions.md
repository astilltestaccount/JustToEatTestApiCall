### How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.


I have spent 10 hours to accomplished this test

  - 2 Hours i have spent to choose Packages which i need to use and also framework for unit test
  - 5 hours i have spent for dev part
  - 2 Hours i have spent for testing. Configure and launch it. 
  - 1 hour for testing all application and fix bugs
  
If i have more time i would like to add 
* Implement PUT,DELETE,POST methods. 
* More abstaction
* Control what authorization  use
* Use ASP.NET instead of Console Application to have better UI

### What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

As I am PHP Developer, unfortunately, i haven't time to catch each new feature in .Net. So i really don't know what is old and what is new:)

### How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

* ASP.Net Health Monitoring 
* Performance Counters for ASP.NET
* EXPLAIN in db
Most performance issues come from : slow 3rd party code, thousands of SQL queries per transaction,locking tables in db, slow SQL Statement, bad application architecture.
So at first need find a root of problem and next find way to monitoring and fix it

### How would you improve the Just Eat APIs that you just used?

* Implement OAuth 2 authentication
* Give More Details in Http method OPTION (end point,short description etc)
